title: Approximating Non-Linear Functions of Gaussians, Kalman Filter Extensions
subtitle: I discuss the generic problem of approximating the distribution resulting from a non-linear transformation of a Gaussian random variable, and then show how this leads to extensions of the Kalman filter which yield approximate filtering algorithms in the non-linear setting.

# TODO
Discuss the change of measure formula for the PDF, extended Kalman filter,
statistically linearlized Kalman filter, Fourier-Hermite Kalman filter,
unscented Kalman filter (see Saarka Bayesian estimation of time-varying
  systems notes).
